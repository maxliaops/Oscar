<h2>Oscar Issues</h2>

<tt>Release version: 1.0.4 - February 18, 2005</tt>

<ul>
   <li>Oscar is not 100% compliant with the OSGi specification yet, but it
       is very close. There are likely some fine-grained
       areas where Oscar differs from the behavior described in the
       specification. The goal is to eliminate these difference, so please
       voice you concern over any divergences that you discover.
   </li>
   <li>Current support for native libraries is not 100% compliant with the
       OSGi specification; the specification says that the framework should
       error if a specified native library does not exist for the platform
       on which the bundle is being installed. From my point of view, this
       is too restrictive since it may actually be the case that you need
       a native library on one platform, but not on another; the OSGi
       specification apparently does not allow this situation but Oscar does.
       This may change or become a configurable "Oscar extension" in the
       future.
   </li>
   <li>Also in native library support, it appears that operating system and
       platform variables are not always consistent on all JVM implementations.
       I have just hardcoded some values from my machines and tried to guess
       reasonably for other values. As a result, Oscar may not recognize
       some platforms. Perhaps these values should be placed in a config
       file or something.
   </li>
</ul>
