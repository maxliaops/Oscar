<ul>

<li>
Oscar has been updated to 1.0.5 and is now
<a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113">available</a>.
This release is mostly a bug fix release, see the
<a href="changes.html">change log</a> for details.
(May 13, 2005)
</li>

<li>
A new, reasonably stable alpha release of Oscar 2.0 is now
<a href="oscar-alpha.html">available</a>. This release can now
install OSGi R3 bundles unchanged, with the exception that
dynamic import is not yet implemented.
(April 27, 2005)
</li>

<li>
An updated alpha release of Oscar 2.0 is now
<a href="oscar-alpha.html">available</a>. This alpha release is nearly
fully functional with respect to Oscar 1.0.4 functionality; however,
it is still only intended for experimental purposes.
(April 17, 2005)
</li>

<li>
An early alpha release of Oscar 2.0 is now
<a href="oscar-alpha.html">available</a>. This alpha release explores adding
new capabilities to the OSGi framework and is for experimental purposes only
(i.e., use at your own risk). (March 14, 2005)
</li>

<li>
Oscar has been updated to 1.0.4 and is now
<a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113">available</a>.
This includes an updated version of OBR and support for proxy authentication when
installing bundles; see the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for details.

<h2>What is Oscar?</h2>

<p>
Oscar is an open source implementation of the Open Services Gateway Initiative
(<a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a>) framework specification; the goal is
to provide a completely compliant implementation of the OSGi framework
specification. Oscar is currently compliant with a large portion of the
OSGi 3 specifications, although certain compliance work still
needs to be completed. Despite this fact, the OSGi framework functionality
provided by Oscar is very stable and is in use by many people.
</p>

<p>
Even though OSGi targets the
<a href="http://www.osgi.org/osgi_technology/download_specs.asp?section=2">embedded device
market</a>, the framework is ideally suited for experimenting with
component-oriented and service-oriented computing in general. For example,
Oscar can be easily embedded into other projects and used as a plugin
or extension mechanism; it serves this purpose much better than other
systems that are used for similar purposes, such as
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/index.html">
Java Management Extensions (JMX)</a>. For some example projects
that use OSGi, refer to the <a href="#community">community
section</a> below.
</p>

<p>
One of the my personal targets in experimenting with Oscar is to
realize <i>dynamic assembly of applications</i>, where only skeleton applications
exist and nearly all functionality is provided and extended at run time by
downloading new components and services. Other areas of interest include security
and techniques for ensuring quality properties of applications in such a
dynamic, component-based environment. Stepping back futher, the notion of
managing and maintaining many hundreds if not thousands of such service containers
dispersed across the Internet is also interesting and harks back to many
software deployment issues.
</p>

<p>
Of course, since OSGi is intended for embedded device applications,
I am also keeping my mind open for interesting applications in those areas
as well. The OSGi framework is small and reasonable lightweight,
which makes it well suited for small devices, like PDAs. For example,
here are some <a href="zaurus.html">screenshots</a> of Oscar running
on a Sharp Zaurus.
</p>

<a name="osgi"></a>
<h2>What is OSGi?</h2>

<p>
OSGi is an independent corporation that is defining a specification to deliver
services over wide-area networks to local area networks and devices. OSGi
has over 70 participants and is currently enjoying industry-wide support.
For more more information on OSGi or to retrieve the specification, refer
to the <a href="http://www.osgi.org/">OSGi web site</a>.
</p>

<a name="status"></a>
<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
Oscar is intended to implement the framework portion of the OSGi specition
and it is currently compliant with a large percentage of the version 3
specification release. Standard OSGi framework-related service
implementations are also provided (such as Package Admin and Start Level),
but other non-framework-related services are only available separately.
There are a few minor <a href="issues.html">known issues</a> and you are
encouraged to <a href="mailto:heavy@ungoverned.org">send email</a> if you
have any specific compliance issues that need to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="bundles"></a>
<h2>Bundles</h2>

<p>
In OSGi, components are called <i>bundles</i>. A bundle is simply
a JAR file containing a manifest file and some combination of Java classes,
native code, embedded JAR files, and resources. A simple
<a href="http://oscar-osgi.sf.net/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> is
available that demonstrates how to write progressively more complex
bundles. Another good way to learn how to write a bundle is to examine
the example bundles included in the <a href="http://oscar-osgi.sf.net/">Oscar
bundle repository</a>. Since OSGi is a standard, it is also possible to
find documentation on writing bundles from other sources; for example,
Sun provides a tutorial for
both <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/tutorialwin.pdf">Windows</a>
and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/tutorialsol.pdf">Solaris</a>.
