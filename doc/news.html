</li>

<li>
<a href="http://oscar.objectweb.org">Oscar</a> is now hosted on

</li>

<li>
The <a href="http://oscar-osgi.sf.net">Oscar Bundle Repository</a> web site
is now online at Oscar's old web address. (June 13, 2004)
</li>

<li>
Updated the <a href="http://oscar-osgi.sf.net/tutorial/">tutorial</a>
to work with version <tt>0.9.4a</tt> of Oscar and to fix bugs in the Ant
build file and example 7. (March 7, 2004)
</li>

<li>
A small update of Oscar, version <tt>0.9.4a</tt>, is available that fixes
a refresh problem for Windows users due to an unclosed file. It is probably
a good idea for Linux users to upgrade too. See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a>
for a complete list of changes. (November 27, 2003)
</li>

<li>
The final release of Oscar version <tt>0.9.4</tt> is available; it contains
some important bug fixes for Windows users, but more importantly adds new
functionality and compliance with the OSGi specification, including
the Start Level service from OSGi 3. See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a>
for a complete list of changes. (November 14, 2003)
</li>

<li>
Michel D'Hooge has made instructions available for using Eclipse and Oscar
together; refer to the <a href="eclipse.html">document</a> for more details.
(November 14, 2003)
</li>

<li>
A second pre-release of version <tt>0.9.4</tt> is available; it fixes many obscure
bugs and a few not so obscure ones. This release should be stable and will be the
last release before the final release of version <tt>0.9.4</tt>. (September 1, 2003)
</li>

<li>
A pre-release of Oscar version <tt>0.9.4</tt> is now available; its version
number is <tt>0.9.4pre1</tt>. This pre-release represents a major re-engineering
effort for Oscar. There is very little new functionality in this release, but
many aspects of Oscar were affected. To see a brief summary of the
changes refer to the <a href="changes.html">change log</a>. Please
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30578">download</a>
this pre-release and send me reports of any issues you uncover.
(June 25, 2003)
</li>

<li>
Yet another minor update to Oscar; the bug fix in the last release did not completely
fix the class loading bug it was supposed to, but I am confident that this update
finally eliminates the issue. See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for other
minor changes; this release should be considered the most stable Oscar release.
(June 16, 2003)
</li>

<li>
Another updated Oscar release that fixes some <a href="changes.html">minor issues</a>; people using versions <tt>0.9.3</tt> or <tt>0.9.3a</tt> should upgrade.
