<h2><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>
Everything needed to run Oscar is included in the release package except
for Java. In order to run Oscar you must install a recent version of either the
Java 2 Development Kit (JDK) or the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE). If
you do not plan to do development, then it is not necessary to install the
JDK, in that case the JRE is sufficient. Java is freely available from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>
To install Oscar you only need to
<a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113">download</a>
the core Oscar release package, which will be named according to this pattern:
<tt>oscar-&lt;release-version&gt;.jar</tt>. After downloading the core Oscar
release package, use the <tt>java</tt> command to execute the JAR file,
like this (the following command assumes that you are trying to install
the 1.0.0 version of Oscar and that you have Java in your
<tt>PATH</tt>):
</p>

<pre>    java -jar oscar-1.0.0.jar<br></pre>

<p>
For the above command to work properly, make sure you enter the name of the
Oscar release package that you downloaded in place of
"<tt>oscar-1.0.0.jar</tt>" in the above example command. For Windows users,
it is often the case that you can just double-click on the JAR file to
execute it. Executing the Oscar release package invokes the installer GUI,
which looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="install.png" alt="[installer]">
</p>

<p>
By default, everything will be installed when you click on the "OK" button.
A text-based command shell is the default means of interacting with Oscar,
but you can choose the GUI shell if you desire; the GUI shell has plugins
for displaying installed bundles, accessing the command shell, and accessing
the bundle repository. To make the GUI shell your default Oscar
shell, click on the corresponding radio button.
</p>

<p>
In addition to selecting the shell,
you can change Oscar's installation directory and which JVM it will use by
editing the corresponding property. The default values should be reasonable
if you are uncertain as to what these values should be. You may also choose
to not install the user or API documentation by disabling the check box
next to the corresponding property. If you have downloaded the documentation
packages separately (perhaps because you are behind a firewall), then
you may type the appropriate "<tt>file://</tt>" URL into the supplied text
field to avoid downloading them again. For directory names, it is best to
avoid using "space" characters, but they should work correctly. The install
process automatically configures the start-up scripts; <tt>oscar.bat</tt>
for Windows and <tt>oscar.sh</tt> for UNIX-based platforms.
</p>

<p>
After installation your Oscar installation directory will contain the
following files and directories:
</p>

<ul>
     <li><tt>LICENSE.txt</tt> - The Oscar license.</li>
     <li><tt>oscar.bat</tt> - Windows batch file to start Oscar.</li>
     <li><tt>oscar.sh</tt> - UNIX script to start Oscar.</li>
     <li><tt>example.policy</tt> - An example permission policy file.</li>
     <li><tt>src.jar</tt> - The source code for everything.</li>
     <li><tt>lib/</tt> - Libraries necessary to run Oscar.</li>
     <li><tt>bundle/</tt> - Bundles necessary to run Oscar's shell and
         user interfaces.</li>
     <li><tt>doc/</tt> - User and API documentation, if selected for
         installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point, you are ready to start using Oscar. Please refer to the
